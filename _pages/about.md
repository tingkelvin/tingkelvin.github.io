Arthur C Clarke said "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" and that's how I feel about the technology I work with. I love machine learning. I am always looking for new projects and challenges to help me explore the field and grow in what I can do. I am fascinated by artificial intelligence and its applications that will enable so many people to reach their full potential.

Love regular workouts. A causual piano player. And dog lover!
