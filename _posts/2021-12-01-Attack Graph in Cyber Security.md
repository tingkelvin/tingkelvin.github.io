### Attack Graph

Directed graph can be used to represent each users' authentication activity over a time of period.

```
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% responsive_image path: assets/attackgraph/attack graph.png class: "img-fluid z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
</div>
```

**The Netowrk Flow Problem**

First we need to define what is network flow problem? 

We are given a directed graph, $$G = (V, E)$$ with $$n$$ vertices, $$m$$ edges, a "source" $$n$$ vertices, and a "sink" vertices $$t$$. Moreover, each edge $$e$$ is associated with a non-negative *capacity* $$c(e)$$. For example, consider the graph,
